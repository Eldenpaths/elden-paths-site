# FILE PLACEMENT GUIDE FOR: voxel_granularity_profile.json

File: voxel_granularity_profile.json
Purpose: Master config for voxel resolution, monitoring, AI behavior, offline logoff triggers, and 3D future readiness.

Suggested Path: /config/engine/voxel_granularity_profile.json

Usage:
- Accessed by all map rendering systems, tile managers, and sketch validators.
- Referenced during tile load, voxel upgrades, combat prep, and fog logic.
- Tied to player logoff triggers to continue world evolution in background AI mode.

Connects to:
- voxel_rendering_rules.json (/config/rendering/)
- micro_voxel maps (per tile: /data/tiles/micro_voxel/)
- admin tools (e.g., /admin/voxel_debug.html)
- sketch scene modifiers (e.g., tide, trail, footprint logic)
- terrain-to-mesh exporter (future: /export/tools/mesh_baker.py)
