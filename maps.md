_This is the world as it is being rediscovered... terrain, ruins, and trails emerge as players explore._

## 📍 Known Landmarks

- **Fort Rock** – An ancient ring of stone, often the first sight seen from the southern desert.
- **Three Sisters Peaks** – Mist-wrapped mountains in the west, rumored to house old caves.
- **Gravesport (Astoria)** – The foggy port city where many begin their coastal journey.
- **Salt Hollow** – A dried lakebed and subterranean stronghold to the east.
- **Watcher’s Crown** – Craggy highlands with a view of much of the inland valleys.
- **Abert Rim** – A sheer fault-wall above the salt marshes of the southeast.
