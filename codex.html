    <h1>Codex of Echoes</h1>

    <h2>The Law of Echoes™</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">In Elden Paths, the world listens. Every vow, every sin, every triumph leaves an Echo. These are not whispers of memory, but threads sewn into the fabric of the land. Echoes can be tracked, judged, or severed. To speak a vow is to bind your soul; to break it is to fracture your Echo. Wounds may heal, but Echoes... they do not forget.</p>
</div>

<div class="codex-entry">
    <img src="assets/glyphs/png/glyph_2.png" alt="Glyph 2" class="glyph-icon" />
    <h2>Fog of Discovery™</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">There is no map drawn in ink that can reveal what the land itself has not yet permitted. The Fog is a veil of the unknown — not mist, but memory. It lifts only as you walk, sketch, or listen. Until then, even the mountains remain hidden. Players who pierce this fog mark the world, earning the right to name, record, and reveal.</p>
</div>

<div class="codex-entry">
    <img src="assets/glyphs/png/glyph_3.png" alt="Glyph 3" class="glyph-icon" />
    <h2>Trailbox Contents</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">Every traveler begins with a Trailbox — not for comfort, but survival. Its contents vary by origin, class, and fate. Some carry tools. Others, relics or wounds. The Trailbox defines your first steps and cannot be altered by mere wish. Only earned story or shared trade may change what lies inside.</p>
</div>

<div class="codex-entry">
    <img src="assets/glyphs/png/glyph_4.png" alt="Glyph 4" class="glyph-icon" />
    <h2>Oath-Binding System™</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">Certain words, when spoken with ritual or intent, carry weight. These are Oaths — and they bind more than the speaker. Oathbound places become visible on the world map. Oaths may protect, punish, or curse. Only a Warden may bind them lawfully. To violate an Oath is to awaken the land’s wrath.</p>
</div>

<div class="codex-entry">
    <img src="assets/glyphs/png/glyph_5.png" alt="Glyph 5" class="glyph-icon" />
    <h2>Player Wounds and Death</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">Wounds in Elden Paths do not fade with time. A broken arm remains broken until tended. A scar becomes part of your story — seen in every sketch, felt in every roll. Death is not always the end, but it is always a fork. Some players return through ritual, others pass into memory, leaving only an Echo.</p>
</div>

<div class="codex-entry">
    <img src="assets/glyphs/png/glyph_6.png" alt="Glyph 6" class="glyph-icon" />
    <h2>Discovery & Naming Rights</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">Those who find a place before all others are granted Naming Rights. It is not a gift, but a burden. The name you speak may last for generations or be overwritten by conquest. The world records who arrived first, and players may challenge or defend these names by action, not debate.</p>
</div>

<div class="codex-entry">
    <img src="assets/glyphs/png/glyph_7.png" alt="Glyph 7" class="glyph-icon" />
    <h2>World Relic Log</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">Some items carry stories so deep they echo beyond the bearer. These are World Relics — artifacts with persistent memory. They may change hands, be buried, or shattered, but their history is never lost. A player who carries a Relic becomes part of its log. Some Relics are cursed with fame.</p>
</div>

<div class="codex-entry">
    <img src="assets/glyphs/png/glyph_8.png" alt="Glyph 8" class="glyph-icon" />
    <h2>Warden’s Ledger</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">The Warden’s Ledger records all that is built, broken, or sworn within a region. Wardens are caretakers — not rulers, but rememberers. Every stone placed in a settlement, every oath drawn in blood, appears in the Ledger. To hold a Ledger is to carry the soul of a region in your pack.</p>
</div>

<div class="codex-entry">
    <img src="assets/glyphs/png/glyph_9.png" alt="Glyph 9" class="glyph-icon" />
    <h2>Relic Binding Rituals</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">Binding a Relic requires more than ownership. It requires sacrifice, alignment, and often blood. A bound Relic is soul-linked — its fate mirrors the Echo who binds it. Destroy the Echo, and the item fades. Attempt to steal it, and it resists. Few survive the full ritual. Fewer attempt it twice.</p>
</div>

<div class="codex-entry">
    <img src="assets/glyphs/png/glyph_10.png" alt="Glyph 10" class="glyph-icon" />
    <h2>Fogbound Notes</h2>
    <p class="codex-text">Not all Fog lifts through travel. Some secrets are buried beneath salt, shadow, or silence. Fogbound Notes are messages left by others — smuggled maps, forgotten signs, or carved warnings. Only those attuned may find them. Often, what is hidden was meant to remain so.</p>
