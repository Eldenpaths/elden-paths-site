      <h3>Fog of Discovery™</h3>
      <p>The world begins hidden to all. Only those who walk the land reveal its form. Each player's view is unique and persistent.</p>
      <h3>Echo System™</h3>
      <p>Every step, wound, and word becomes a memory in the world. These echoes can be seen by others if they retrace your steps.</p>
      <h3>Oath-Binding™</h3>
      <p>Special classes may bind locations through ritual or conquest. These become protected, named zones until challenged or undone.</p>
